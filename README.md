# advent-of-code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly event held each December. Each day brings a two new (programming) puzzles. Here I will be uploading some of my puzzle solutions under GPLv3.

## Build and run
So far I have only published solutions in Rust. This will change as I find, consolidate or recreate other years' solutions.

Change your working directory to `advent_2021`. Each puzzle is divided into a unit test. Run the unit tests with `cargo test`; specific unit tests with `cargo test <fn name>`. You can see the performance of solutions with `cargo bench`. The `nightly` toolchain is required due to the use of benchmarks.

TODO: scorch (history rewrite) inputs and replace with only the examples.
